<h1>Personal Finances Dashboard</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This dashboard uses data from an excel file that was filled by communication with the client to create meaningful and aesthetic visuals while keeping everything easy to understand as the client was of an older age. The dashboard follows a white and forest green theme. It summarizes the clients expenses and saving which can be filtered by each month of the year showing what are the highest expenses and what months they have saved money or overspent using graphs, pie-charts, bar-charts and multiple KPI's. It also shows the trends on the second page to show how a change in income can affect spending or saving.
The third page shows the gradual increase in thier savings over the months to understand the increase in thier networth over these months.
